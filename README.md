## Ash Olorenshaw

Hey, I'm Ash! I do a lot of writing in

- Python
- C
- F#
- Powershell Script

No matter what people say, I'm going to continue running PowerShell as my shell of choice on Linux!! ([Even if it can be awkward occasionally](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/issues/3270))

Other miscellaneous opinions:
- HTMX is really nice
- .NET is impressively fast
- C is still very relevant and very powerful - the more and more I write it the more I feel we don't need to replace it (some tweaks would be nice, but nothing massive is necessary)
- avoid object oriented stuff (it has it's place - UI and stuff, but it's not *necessary* for most stuff)
- programming *is* and should be **fun**!


**Live long and prosper**
