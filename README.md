## Ash Olorenshaw

Hey, I'm Ash! I do a lot of writing in

- C
- Python
- F#
- JS/TS (reluctantly)

No matter what people say, I'm going to continue running PowerShell as my shell of choice on Linux!! ([Even if it can be awkward occasionally](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/issues/3270))

Other miscellaneous opinions:
- HTMX is really nice - honestly covers most usecases for basic websites (so does Vanilla JS)
- .NET is impressively fast
- C is still very relevant and very powerful. We don't need to replace it!
- OOP is only good when it's *relevant*. If it's not relevant, then it's just a complication
- programming *is* and *should* be **fun**!
