## Ash Olorenshaw

Hey, I'm Ash - I do a lot of writing in

- Python
- F#
- Odin
- Powershell Script

No matter what people say, I'm going to continue running PowerShell as my shell of choice on Linux!!

Other miscellaneous opinions:
- HTMX is really nice
- .NET is impressively fast
- avoid OO (as much as feasibly possible)
- programming *is fun*!


**Live long and prosper**
